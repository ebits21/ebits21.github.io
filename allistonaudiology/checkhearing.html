   <h1>Checking for Hearing Loss</h1>
  <img src="images/family.jpg" class="img_right">    
  <p>Three types of hearing checks are available:</p> 
   <ol>
    <li>Comprehensive Assessment,</li>
    <li>Basic Test</li> 
    <li>and Hearing Screening.</li>
   </ol> 
  <p>We recommend a <strong>Comprehensive Assessment.</strong> Basic testing has been available and unchanged since the 1980s and is <em>not recommended</em>. Hearing Screening can determine if a comprehensive assessment is warranted.</p>
  <blockquote>It is recommended that people over fifty years of age get their hearing checked regularly.</blockquote>
  <h2>COMPREHENSIVE ASSESSMENT</h2>
  <p>Your audiologist will begin with a core set of tests:</p> 
  <ul>
   <li>Video inspection of the ear (video otoscopy)</li> 
   <li>Eardrum movement testing (tympanometry and middle ear muscle reflex testing)</li> 
   <li>Puretone testing at up to 10 tones (audiometry)</li>
   <li>Speech testing (speech audiometry)</li> 
  </ul>
  <p>Depending on initial results, your Audiologist may select further relevant tests including:</p>
  <ul>
   <li>Inner ear hair cell testing (otoacoustic emission test)</li> 
   <li>High frequency audiometry (9000 to 16000 Hz for chemotherapy, radiation therapy monitoring)</li> 
   <li>Speech-in-noise testing</li> 
   <li>Tinnitus testing (tinnitus matching)</li> 
  </ul>
 <p>and others.</p>
  <h2>BASIC TEST</h2>
  <p>A basic hearing test <em>only</em> includes the following:</p>
  <ul>
   <li>Looking into your ear (otoscopy)</li> 
   <li>Eardrum movement testing (tympanometry)</li>
   <li>Puretone testing, often at about 6 tones (audiometry)</li> 
   <li>and speech testing (speech audiometry)</li> 
  </ul>
  <h2>SCREENING</h2>
  <p>Hearing screenings are generally performed at work or in the community and generally use a pass/fail criteria. For example, if your hearing level was lower than a set level, you would be referred for a comprehensive assessment.</p>
