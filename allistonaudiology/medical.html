    <h1>Medical Conditions and Hearing Loss</h1>
  <p>Several medical conditions are risk factors for hearing loss.  Consulting your physician to assess, treat, and monitor these medical conditions is important to limit the negative impact on your health and your hearing.</p>  
  <p>In addition, assessment, treatment, and monitoring of your hearing loss by an audiologist can decrease the negative impact on your quality of life.</p>
  <h2>Cancer and Hearing loss</h2>
  <p>We are very fortunate to have access to more and more life-saving cancer treatments.  These life-saving treatment such as head/neck radiation and chemotherapy can cause hearing loss.</p>  
  <p>Baseline measurements prior to treatment, ototoxic monitoring during and/or after treatment, and management of hearing loss are recommended</p>
  <h2>Diabetes and Hearing Loss</h2>
  <p>Hearing loss is twice as common in people with diabetes as it is in those who don't have the disease.  The reason remains unclear. It is possible that the high blood glucose levels associated with diabetes cause damage to the small blood vessels in the inner ear, similar to the way in which diabetes can damage the eyes and the kidneys.</p>
  <h2>Cardiovascular Disease and Hearing Loss</h2>
  <p>Heart health has been linked to hearing loss for many years.  Patients with good cardiovascular health have been shown to have better hearing.  Poor cardiovascular health has been associated with low-frequency hearing loss.</p>
  <h2>Mental Health and Hearing Loss</h2>
  <p>Early diagnosis and treatment of hearing loss slows the progression of dementia and Alzheimer's disease.  This effect is evident in even milder losses and is more pronounced in more severe hearing loss. </p>
  <h2>Ear infections in children</h2>
  <p>Middle ear fluid in children typically causes a temporary, mild to moderate, loss of hearing in both ears.   Ear infections and upper respiratory infections are a common cause of middle ear fluid.</p>  
  <p>In some children, speech and language development can be affected by persistent middle ear fluid.</p>
