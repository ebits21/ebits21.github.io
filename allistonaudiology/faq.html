   <dt>How young can children be tested?</dt>
   <dd>It is never too early to test your child's hearing! The hearing of infants is screened within the first 2 days of life through the Infant Hearing Program of Ontario (IHP). We also test children at all ages who passed the IHP screening but need testing for other reasons such as ear infections and delayed speech development.</dd>

   <dt>How often should I have my hearing tested?</dt>
   <dd>Once hearing loss has been established, hearing testing annually or every two years is recommended.</dd>

   <dt>Do I have to take out my hearing aid to talk on the telephone?</dt>
   <dd>No. Newer hearing aids have anti-whistling (anti-feedback) features or telecoils that allow people to hear on the telephone with hearing aids in. In fact, new hearing aids often allow individuals to hear the telephone in both ears, thereby improving hearing performance on the phone.</dd>

   <dt>How often do I have to clean my hearing aids?</dt>
   <dd>Hearing aids should be cleaned nightly by wiping them with a cloth or tissue and by using the supplied cleaning tools.  Many hearing aids have disposable wax guards (plugs) that can prevent wax from collecting in hearing aids.</dd>
