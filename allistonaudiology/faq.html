  <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1> 
  <dl>
   <dt>Do I need a referral?</dt>
   <dd>No. simply call, email or drop in to set up and appointment.</dd>
   
   <dt>How long has the clinic been in operation?</dt>
   <dd>Alliston Audiology has been providing audiological services since 1990.  Alliston Audiology operated at Stevenson Memorial Hospital until 1998 when the clinic expanded and moved to Windsor House on Victoria Street in Alliston.  Orangeville Hearing Clinic has been providing audiological services since 1988.</dd>
  
   <dt>Will I see an Audiologist for all hearing testing, hearing aid prescriptions and hearing aid fittings?</dt>
   <dd>Yes.</dd>
 
   <dt>What services and products are covered/funded by the government?</dt>
   <dd>We provide government-funded services and products from the Infant Hearing Program of Ontario (IHP), Workplace Safety and Insurance Board (WSIB, formerly WCB), Veterans Affairs Canada (VAC, formerly DVA), the Assistive Devices Program of Ontario (ADP), Ontario Works, Ontario Disability Support Program (ODSP), Assistance for Children with Severe Disabilities (ACSD) and others.</dd>
  
   <dt>How young can children be tested?</dt>
   <dd>It is never too early to test your child's hearing! The hearing of infants is screened within the first 2 days of life through the Infant Hearing Program of Ontario (IHP). We also test children at all ages who passed the IHP screening but need testing for other reasons such as ear infections and delayed speech development.</dd>
  
   <dt>How often should I have my hearing tested?</dt>
   <dd>Once hearing loss has been established, hearing testing annually or every two years is recommended.</dd>

   <dt>Are the latest hearing aids available at your clinic?</dt>
   <dd>Yes. We pride ourselves on having the latest equipment to set up hearing aids that are state-of-the-art technology.</dd>

   <dt>How long do hearing aid batteries last?</dt>
   <dd>Hearing aid batteries last from 4 days to 21 days depending on the sizes.</dd>
   
   <dt>Why do hearing aids whistle?</dt>
   <dd>Older hearing aids were more susceptible to feedback or whistling. Today's hearing aid technology has sophisticated anti-whistling technology.</dd>
  
   <dt>Do I have to take out my hearing aid to talk on the telephone?</dt>
   <dd>No. Newer hearing aids have anti-whistling (anti-feedback) features or telecoils that allow people to hear on the telephone with hearing aids in. In fact, new hearing aids often allow individuals to hear the telephone in both ears, thereby improving hearing performance on the phone.</dd>
 
   <dt>How often do I have to clean my hearing aids?</dt>
   <dd>Hearing aids should be cleaned nightly by wiping them with a cloth or tissue and by using the supplied cleaning tools.  Many hearing aids have disposable wax guards (plugs) that can prevent wax from collecting in hearing aids.</dd>
